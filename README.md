This is a modified version of CLASS (v2.5.0).

To extract dynamical evolution of the EoS of dark energy, I add the support
of using tabulated {wi} at low redshfits to approximate w(z).

Currently only the background part is modified, so we have to swtich off the
perturbations from dark energy.  Later we will implement an equivalent PPF
formalism.

TODO:

1) modify perturbation evolution of dark energy.
